    "description": "With its soaring flutes and layered harmonies, \"The Lion's Roar\" conjures the pastoral, almost Andean sound of Fleet Foxes' \"Your Protector.\" Stomping drums and a strummed acoustic guitar bring welcome fire to the mix. However, it's the Söderberg sisters' soulful vocal harmonies — especially during a short but haunting a cappella interlude — that set First Aid Kit apart.",

    "description": "Much of the beauty of the opening title song and its accompanying track, \"Stay Another Season,\" lies in the way that the Avalanches turn obvious sonic mismatches into something all their own. It's not too common that you'll hear a sample of a horse, a rastafarian singer, and an invitation to a Club Med disco all in the same song, but somehow it makes perfect sense under the masterful direction of the Avalanches.",
